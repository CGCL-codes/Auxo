# Auxo: A Scalable and Efficient Graph Stream Summarization Structure

Auxo is a scalable graph stream summarization structure with high efficiency. Auxo leverages binary logarithmic search and common binary prefixes embedding to provide a space/time efficient scalable tree structure, reducing the item insert/query time from $O(N)$ to $O(logN)$ as well as reducing the total storage cost in a $logN$ scale.

## Introduction

A graph stream refers to a time sequentially updating stream of edges, forming a huge and fast-evolving graph. The vast volume and high update speed of a graph stream bring stringent requirements for the data management structure, including sublinear space cost, constant time cost for updating, and scalability of the structure. Existing designs summarize a graph stream by leveraging a hash-based compressed matrix and representing an edge using its fingerprint to achieve practical storage for a graph stream with a known upper bound of data volume. However, they fail to support the dynamically extending of a graph stream.  

Existing graph stream summarizations represent the original graph stream with a hash-based compressed matrix and denote the items using their Boolean labels, achieving an approximate and practical storage scheme with sublinear memory cost. Howeer, their size-predefined compressed structures do not scale facing real-world graph streams where edges arrive continuously with unknown bounds.

To address this issue, we propose Auxo which is based on a novel prefix embedded tree (PET), leveraging binary logarithmic search and common binary prefixes embedding to provide a space/time efficient scalable tree structure. PET reduces the item insert/query time from $O(|E|)$ to $O(log|E|)$ as well as reducing the total storage cost in a $log|E|$ scale, where $|E|$ is the scale of the dataset.

Below shows our inisght of PET structure. PET extends new building blocks in a tree-style to achieve logarithmic computation cost for insert/query processing. Moreover, PET embeds the prefix information inside the tree. Thus, in all the extended building blocks on the ùëñth level of the tree, Auxo can omit an ùëñ-bit prefix for every inserted fingerprint without sacrificing query accuracy.

To further improve the memory utilization of PET, we propose a proportionally incremental strategy to expand PET by exploiting the principle of proportional sequence. Our proposed incremental expanding scheme decomposes the exponentially expanding of a new level into a proportionally incremental sequence, avoiding the under-utilization of memory. Below is an example of our proportional incremental strategy. Every time when the Main tree(a PET) extends to the next level, it constructs a Deputy tree to do this in a level-by-level way. Whenever Deputy tree extends, it moves the edge stored in the current level to the newest level and free the memory of the old level.

## About the source code and data sets

We have implemented the basic idea GSS_Chain (GSS_Chain.cpp), Auxo (Auxo.cpp), and proportional Auxo (AuxoPro.cpp) in C++. The source code is in the "Auxo" directory. We complete the code on Linux 5.4.0-99-generic and compile successfully using gcc 11.3.0.

All the data sets we use can be downloaded from the below website (In the "data" directory, we also upload a small test dataset demo "lkml" wiht only several millions of edges due to the size limitation of the project uploaded. We recommend you to evaluate the performance of Auxo on much larger dataset!!!!!!):  
```
    https://catalog.caida.org/details/dataset/passive_2015_pcap  
    http://konect.cc/networks/
```

The data sets should be preprocessed to the format as below:  
* rawdata.txt -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line  
    The meaning of the columns are:  
    ```
        First column: ID of source node  
        Second column: ID of destination node  
        Third column: edge weight  
        Fourth column: timestamp of the edge  
     ```

* edgeQueryTest.txt -- Test data for edge query
    The meaning of the columns are:
    ```
        First column: ID of source node  
        First column: ID of destination node  
        Third column: Accumulated weight of the edge  
    ```


* nodeOutQueryTest.txt & nodeInQueryTest.txt -- Test data for node out (in)-flow query
    The meaning of the columns are:  
    ```
        First column: ID of source (destination) node  
        Second column: Accumulated weight of the node  
    ```

## How to run
### Run the demo
Suppose you've already cloned the repository.  
You just need:
```
    $ cd Auxo/build  
    $ cmake .. && make
    $ cd ../bin && ./main (or cd ../ && sh demo.sh)
    
```
### Parameter setting

```
    $ -dataset path of the graph stream dataset
    $ -result output result path
    $ -fpl length of the fingerprint
    $ -width side with of the compressed matrix
    $ -cols length of the hash address sequence
    $ candiNum  number of the canidate buckets
```
A demo of the parameter setting could be find in file demo.sh
## Other related work

We also collect other related work of graph stream summarization strutures to compare and put their code in the "baseline" directory. 

## Evaluation Result

Here, we show the result on data set Friendster. This is the friendship network of the online social site Friendster, where nodes represent users and a directed
edge denotes that a user adds another user to his or her friend list. The dataset contains 68 million nodes and 2.6 billion edges.

Auxo and Auxo_pro reduce the edge query time by one to two orders of magnitude for all the data sets compared with GSS_Chain and Scube_Chain. For node in-flow query, both Auxo and Auxo_pro outperform GSS_Chain and Scube_Chain, reducing the query time by about one order of magnitude. For node out-flow query, Auxo and Scube_Chain achieve comparable performance, both outperformance GSS_Chain.

We also compare Auxo with other scalable graph stream summarization structures like Horae, MoSSo, SGS and the results show Horae and Auxo achieve nearly the same performance on update speed and are about two orders of magnitude faster than MoSSo and SGS. Moreover Auxo reduces the memory cost by more than one order of magnitude
compared to other structures.
